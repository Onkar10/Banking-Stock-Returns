### INTRODUCTION
Description of Data Sets:

Our data set comprises of stock prices of the following companies taken over a time period of 35 years with frequency of one month:

BAC – Bank of America

BKC - Bank of New York Mellon

C – Citi Group

PNC – PNC Financial Services

WFC - Wells Fargo

All the above companies are from the Finance Industry and we obtained the data from Yahoo Finance.

Project Goals:

Halloween Effect- It is a market timing strategy which is based on the theory that stocks perform better between September through the April period. It is popularized by the well-known saying “Sell in May and go away” which typically suggests that we should buy the stocks in the September period and sell them in May to reap positive returns. 
Our goal in this project is to understand and analyze the behavior of stock in this period every year and,  by using statistical tools to analyze the data over past years, to conclude whether it is indeed a good idea to buy stocks in September period and sell in May or otherwise.
